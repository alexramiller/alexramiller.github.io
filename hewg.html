	<h1>Bay Area Site Distribution Map</h1>
	<p>This map displays an analysis of the distribution of housing unit capacity across Bay Area jurisdictions with certified 6th Cycle Housing Elements.*</p>
	<p>A "Fair Housing Land Use Score" is calculated for each jurisdiction, ranging from a score of -1 to +1. 
		<ul>
			<li>A score of <b>-1</b> indicates that a jurisdiction has located all of its housing capacity in its lowest-income neighborhood (for "median income" layers) or its least white neighborhood (for "% white" layers).</li>
			<li>A score of <b>+1</b> indicates that a jurisdiction has located all of its housing capacity in its highest-income neighborhood or its most white neighborhood. </li>
			<li>A score of <b>0</b> indicates that housing capacity is relatively evenly distributed by income or race.</li> 
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>These scores are calculated for four different combinations of variables:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Median Income vs. Total Units:</b> The distribution of housing unit capacity compared with neighborhood income.</li>
			<li><b>Median Income vs. Low-Income:</b> The distribution of sites specifically reserved for new low-income housing units compared with neighborhood income.</li>
			<li><b>% White vs. Total Units:</b> The distribution of housing unit capacity compared with the share of a neighborhood that is white.</li>
			<li><b>% White vs. Low-Income:</b> The distribution of sites specifically reserved for new low-income housing units compared with the share of a neighborhood that is white.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>This map also includes the following additional layers:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Tract Median Income:</b> Distribution of neighborhoods by income</li>
			<li><b>Tract % White:</b> Distribution of neighborhoods by % white</li>
			<li><b>Total Units:</b> Approximate location of housing sites, characterized by total number of proposed housing units</li>
			<li><b>Low-Income Units:</b> Approximate location of sites specifically for low-income housing units</li>
		</ul>
